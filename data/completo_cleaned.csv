anyone and everyone. this is a community problem, so everyone who wants to be part of the solution should be allowed to help. as i said above: remove all protections on free ranging cats, and allow people to help. people who allow their pets to roam outside are part of the problem, because their pets are part of the problem. it would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

years ago some vermont acquaintances got one warning from the ranger: next time i see your dog running deer, i'll shoot it. next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. they are serious about threats. we just want to feel good about ourselves. if we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. neutered cats eat birds. don't release them. kill them."

but ""domestic abuse"" is idiotic--and misleading, and a misrepresentation. it is not domesticity that is being abused, nor is it ""domestics"".

it's assault within a partner relationship--and even that's a bit slippery: typically, it's woman-battering.

speaking of idiocy...i found this amusing: the former editor says, ""social media has let loose all kinds of dark instincts that were lurking. when you thought it was just your own dark thoughts, and there was nobody who shared them, maybe you wouldn't have been so loud about them. but when you find there are a whole bunch of people who agree, it does give you volume.""

social media doesn't care about the type of thoughts or instincts. neither does msm. it disseminates everything, ""dark"" or ""light.""  and without social media, who would read/see/hear feminists' thoughts?  well, there'd be ""nobody who shared them,"" and nobody'd know that ""there are a whole bunch of people who agree.""

blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.""

regardless of the reason, telling people in a country that has been attacked three times in less than three months by islamic fanatics “not to be alarmed” is the height of irresponsible stupidity.

there are indeed so many citizen see-something say-something reports of islamic nut jobs that need watching, this tsunami of citizen reporting has totally overwhelmed the resources of mi5 and british law enforcement. there are no near term prospects of things getting much better either, not until major budgetary outlays can be conjured up to massively expand law enforcement resources in the uk.

those who seek to blame all this on our president are merely confessing to have succumbed to tds (trump derangement syndrome) and should seek psychiatric intervention.

you know normal, 
that thing where civility for other opinions, including ones that make us uncomfortable, but we cherish because our forefathers gave their lives for it.
that thing where immigrant policy is grilled because it stinks.
that thing where marxist anti-fa and their supporters and kkk and theirs  are treated equally. they are not beaten, but, taught that somewhere in between is ok.

that thing where stupid self righteous lesb!an shrews are outed for their closet hate of normal people.
there are so may others but this is a start.

we will also bring sanity to the marxist narco-fem argument that dickless wimps are great rulers.
