you can have evidence and in this case there seems to be many converging threads of evidence. the question is, why is all this evidence appearing in the political discourse now? some people think that it's because obama's a sore loser, or the intelligence communities want to embarass trump, or they are simply inept. 

my theory is simpler. there is evidence because the attempt to influence the election was real and the dividends the russians will accrue as a result are considerable. they aren't stupid."
